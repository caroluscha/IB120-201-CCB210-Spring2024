Using a standard task you show images of faces, houses, and noise patterns, and ask participants to respond to each image by saying ‘face’ or ‘not face’. You set the experiment so that, across the whole experiment, the number of images per stimuli type are evenly split (1/3 probability per type), but they are not necessarily evenly split in any one block. Across the entire experiment, there are 180 total images. Each block contains 60 trials, a single trial consists of a single image draw, and each block resamples from the entire set of 180 images."
